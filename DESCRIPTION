Description: The machine learning based measurement of neuron maturity: Neuron Maturity
	Index (NMI). Based on the expression levels (in FPKM) of marker genes in each functional
	module, it uses the trained LASSO model to estimate degrees of general maturity for the
	given samples, which can be either bulk purified neurons or single neuron.
